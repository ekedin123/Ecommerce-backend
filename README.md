  ## Usage 
   - the user will clone the github project into their own machine, through their code studio, open a new terminal and install the dependencies with `npm i`  
   - once the dependencies are downloaded, the user runs `mysql -u root -p` to initialize the mysql server
   - once logged in, the user can then check if the database is linked properly with `source db/schema.sql`
   - once seeded, run the program with either `npm run start` or `node server.js`
   - the user can test routes by using the http requests in Insomnia to view the data that has been created.
